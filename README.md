# Capstone II Final Porject Team 14
The aim of this project is to bring facial tracking technology to drones. 
This will be accomplished by the development of a computer vision algorithm 
for facial detection that will interface with and control the drone. The 
droneâ€™s camera will communicate with a Haar cascade object detection model to 
gather information about the presence and location of a human face and make 
decisions about how the drone should be maneuvered to locate and track the 
face. The development of the technology in this project will have benefits for 
surveillance, tracking, and the film industry.
